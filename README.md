# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction
Bitcoin presents an interesting parallel to this as it is a time series
prediction problem in a market still in its transient stage. As a result,
there is high volatility in the market and this provides an opportunity in
terms of prediction. In addition, Bitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency in
the world with adoption growing consistently over time. Due to the open
nature of Bitcoin it also poses another paradigm as opposed to traditional
financial markets.

I predicted the prices of bitcoin for 10 days which are not in the dataset,
and appended the value in the feature, which was to be predicted and
then visualized the predictions and the dataset values through a graph
with respect to the change in dates.
